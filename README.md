# Angular Challenge

This repository is a challenge to test basic skills in GIT and Angular.

There is several ways to answer, feel free to do as you like !

## Prerequisites

- A Github account, create one if you do not have one
- Node JS : https://nodejs.org
- Angular CLI https://cli.angular.io

## Development server

Start with `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Steps of the challenge

Important : Each step should be _committed individually_ (unless the 1st, because it does not produce any change).

1. Fork this repository on Github. This repo should appear in your Github profile as your project.
2. Replace the "A new challenge" title by "Angular Challenge".
3. Replace the "2" in the sub-title by a "4".
4. We want to the average sales per week for each game console and each year to fullfil the table. Do as you want.
5. Using the same items, we want to display the most sold game console and the less sold game console. The calculation has to be dynamic : a change in the values should automatically change the result.

Once completed, please send the URL of your Github repository to the person that send you the test. Good luck !
